Parser Modules
==============
The parser modules are the one which works directly with a
parser in order to process a code file and get processed
data structures. With these datastructures you will be able
to work in your security modules.

You should have a parser module for each programming language
you want to work with, but can have different parser for the
same programming language if you like.
