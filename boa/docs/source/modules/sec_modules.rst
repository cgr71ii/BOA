Security Modules
================
Security modules are the main way a user can define its own
modules in order to look for a concrete threat.

These modules can be found in boa's folder, concretely in the
directory "modules". The files you will find there will have
a name like "boam_whatever.py", but is not necessary to follow
the nomenclature. You can name your modules as you like.
